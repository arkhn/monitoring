## How to use Grafana

If Grafana and Prometheus are up and running, you can go to `<grafana_host>:<grafana_port>` in your browser.

For now, login isn't setup so you can use the user "admin" and the password "admin".

### Explore dashboards

To see all the available dashboards, hover over the "Dashboards" menu in the left panel and click on "Manage".
